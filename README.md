# TechWritingPortfolio
This is my portfolio of technical writing samples and other examples of my work. It includes the following items:

### Anomaly Report-EXP
This is an Anomaly Report I wrote about a fictional space program called the Europa Exploration Program (EXP). It details an anomaly scenario with an executive summary, timeline of events, and root cause investigation summary.

### Writing Presentations
These are presentations I used while teaching college composition at San Jacinto College.

### Master's Project
This is the final project I wrote for my Master's degree in Literature at the University of Houston - Clear Lake.
