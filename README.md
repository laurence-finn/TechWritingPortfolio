# Laurence Finn's Technical Writing Portfolio
This is my portfolio of technical writing samples and other examples of my work. It includes the following items:

### Anomaly Report-EXP
This is a sample Anomaly Report I wrote about a fictional space program called the Europa Exploration Program (EXP). It details an anomaly scenario with an executive summary, project background, and timeline of the anomaly. (All the details in this report are fictional.) **Note that this has not been reviewed by a subject matter expert.**

### College Composition Teaching Presentations
These are presentations I used while teaching college composition at San Jacinto College.

### Master's Project
This is the final project I wrote for my Master's degree in Literature at the University of Houston - Clear Lake. 

### Resume
A current copy of my resume.

### Links to Novels
One of my hobbies is novel writing. I've written two books so far, and they can be found on Amazon in Kindle format or paperback:
